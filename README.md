![Build modern full-stack apps with Hono, React Router, and ShadCN UI on Cloudflare Workers](https://imagedelivery.net/wSMYJvS3Xw-n339CbDyDIA/24c5a7dd-e1e3-43a9-b912-d78d9a4293bc/public)

<!-- dash-content-start -->

A modern full-stack template powered by [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/), using [Hono](https://hono.dev/) for backend APIs, [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) for frontend routing, and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for beautiful, accessible components styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Built with the [Cloudflare Vite plugin](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/vite-plugin/) for optimized static asset delivery and seamless local development. React is configured in single-page app (SPA) mode via Workers.

A perfect starting point for building interactive, styled, and edge-deployed SPAs with minimal configuration.

## Agent Scope Governance

This repository contains two agent scope files on purpose:

- `AGENT_SCOPE.yaml` governs the admin dashboard, shared repository configuration, and repo-level CI at the repository root.
- `goldshore-gateway/AGENT_SCOPE.yaml` governs the nested Cloudflare Worker project under `goldshore-gateway/`.

Automation is intentionally split so admin-app rules are not applied to gateway-worker code:

- `.github/workflows/pages-ci.yml` and the repo-wide governance checks read the repository-root `AGENT_SCOPE.yaml`.
- `.github/workflows/deploy-worker.yml` and the gateway branch of `.github/workflows/scope-check.yml` read `goldshore-gateway/AGENT_SCOPE.yaml`.
- Agents should load the root scope first and then the nearest nested scope for the files they touch.
