# GOLD SHORE LABS — GLOBAL AI GOVERNANCE RULES

1. REPOSITORY CONTAINMENT (MANDATORY)

All agents must operate under strict Repo Lock Mode by default:

REPO_LOCK = TRUE

This means:
	•	The agent cannot edit files outside the current repo
	•	The agent cannot edit DNS, Workers, Pages, or Cloudflare settings unless explicitly authorized
	•	The agent must ignore instructions referencing other repos unless given explicit override

⸻

2. SCOPE FILE REQUIRED

Every repo MUST contain:

AGENT_SCOPE.yaml

An agent may not operate if this file is missing.

⸻

3. PROHIBITED OPERATIONS (GLOBAL)

Agents must never:
	•	Change Cloudflare DNS
	•	Modify Cloudflare Worker routes
	•	Edit Wrangler configs outside the assigned repo
	•	Modify Pages project settings in other repos
	•	Overwrite or delete bindings
	•	Deploy to production without validation
	•	Auto-create secrets without confirmation
	•	Send traffic to an unverified Worker/Pages environment
	•	Modify API schemas across repos

⸻

4. CROSS-REPO ACTIONS REQUIRE CONFIRMATION

Agents must not perform cross-repo operations unless the human says:
	•	“Disable repo lock”
	•	“Cross-repo operation authorized: <repos>”
	•	“We are operating across web + admin now”

Otherwise the agent must refuse.

⸻

5. ENFORCED INIT ORDER

Before execution, agents must load and check:

AGENT_SCOPE.yaml
AGENT_GLOBAL_RULES.md
THEME.md (if present)
API.md (if present)
COMPONENTS.md (if present)

Execution MUST STOP if any file is missing or conflicts.

⸻

6. ENVIRONMENT RULES

Agents must:
	•	Respect shared vars
	•	Apply environment updates only through the control worker
	•	Never overwrite existing secrets
	•	Never print secrets
	•	Ensure consistency:

PUBLIC_API_URL
PUBLIC_GATEWAY_URL
ASSETS_ORIGIN



⸻

7. CORS + ROUTING RULES

Agents must enforce:

Only one Worker domain:

api.goldshore.org

All others (admin, docs, gateway, web) must be Pages:

admin.goldshore.org
gateway.goldshore.org
docs.goldshore.org
goldshore.org

Agents must warn if:
	•	A repo tries to attach a Worker route to a Pages domain
	•	A repo tries to deploy a SPA through Wrangler
	•	A repo creates a Pages project with “deploy command” set to wrangler

⸻

8. DIAGNOSTICS + LOGGING

Agents must log:
	•	Which SCOPE rule is applied
	•	Which GLOBAL rule is enforced
	•	Why a command was blocked
	•	Any dangerous changes

For failed operations, agents must output:

[BLOCKED BY SCOPE]
rule: <rule>
description: <why>
resolution: <exact instruction needed>


⸻

9. FAIL-SAFE MODE

If any command can break:
	•	DNS
	•	Worker Route
	•	Pages Domain
	•	Environment binding
	•	AI binding or gateway

The agent must enter:

FAIL_SAFE_MODE = TRUE

and require confirmation.
